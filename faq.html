BDSM is a broad term used to describe different types of consensual role-play,

<ul>
  <li><b>Bondage & Discipline</b> – rules, structure, training, or physical restraint</li>
  <li><b>Dominance & Submission</b> – power exchange, control, obedience, or service</li>
  <li><b>Sadism & Masochism</b> – enjoying giving or receiving pain in agreed situations</li>

These activities are always based on consent, trust, and clear boundaries.
That is what separates BDSM from abuse.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>My results don’t feel right or I’m not happy with them</h3>
<p>
This usually happens when a question is read differently than it was intended,

used in the test. That’s completely okay. You know yourself better than any test ever could,
and you’re free to interpret your results in a way that feels right to you.
</p>

<h3>Can you send me my original answers?</h3>
