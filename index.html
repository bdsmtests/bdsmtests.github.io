    <h2>What is the BDSM Test?</h2>
    <p>The BDSM Test is a fork of <a href="http://sapplyvalues.github.io/">Sapply Values</a> that aims to put sexuality on a compass. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a compass with the values of dominant or submissive and experimentalist or vanilla, along with a meter from asxeul to hypersexual. There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.The in depth BDSM Test quiz helps you better understand what Kinks, fetishes, or personality fit with you. Whether you're just starting to learn about it or already have experience.

There are also niche quizzes such as a gay slave quiz, sadomaso test, fetishes test, fisting test, or even variations like a teste bdsm or bbdsm quiz—each offering a different angle on self-discovery within the BDSM spectrum.</p>
